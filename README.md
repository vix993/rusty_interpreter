# Rusty Interpreter

The beginning of a ByteCode interpreter built with rust.


## Instructions

You can run the program by having rust and cargo [installed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

Then you can run `cargo build`, `cargo check`, `cargo test` and `cargo run` in the root directory.

## Motivation

This project was the result of an online challenge.

I was given the following prompt:

Add a data type `ByteCode` that can represent bytecode like in the example
above, along with an interpreter for said bytecode.
